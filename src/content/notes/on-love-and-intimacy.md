# On Love and Intimacy

Love is not just a feeling—it's a practice. A daily choice to show up, to be present, to choose the other person even when it's difficult.

## The Art of Being Seen

True intimacy requires the courage to be fully seen. Not just the polished, presentable parts of ourselves, but the messy, uncertain, sometimes broken pieces that we'd rather keep hidden.

> "To love someone is to see the face of God." — Victor Hugo

When we allow ourselves to be truly known by another, we create space for them to be truly known as well. This mutual vulnerability is the foundation of deep connection.

## Respect as the Foundation

Love without respect is not love at all. Respect means honoring the other person's autonomy, their right to their own thoughts and feelings, even when they differ from our own.

It means listening not to respond, but to understand. It means holding space for their growth, even when it takes them in directions we didn't expect.

## The Sacred in the Ordinary

Reverence in love means finding the sacred in the ordinary moments. The way they make coffee in the morning. The sound of their laughter. The way they care for others when they think no one is watching.

These small acts of love, repeated daily, create the fabric of a life shared together.

## The Work of Love

Love is work. It requires intention, attention, and sometimes sacrifice. It means choosing to love even when the feeling isn't there, trusting that the feeling will follow the action.

The most profound love stories aren't about finding the perfect person—they're about choosing to love the imperfect person you've found, day after day, year after year.
