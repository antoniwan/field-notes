				<h2>A Field Manual for Being Human</h2>
				
				<p>
					I've been stacking notes since college—two decades of chaos in notebooks, scattered insights from work, family, failure. Now I'm pulling them into a field manual for being human.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've built and broken, raised kids mine and not mine, loved, lost, killed my ego more times than I can count. Lesson by lesson, the pattern's clear: intellect without emotional intelligence is hollow, happiness comes not from purity but from truth.
				</p>

				<h2>The Experiment is Open Source</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>The Field Notes on (Modern) Humanity</strong> is a report: what I've seen, tried, built, broken, and what held. Axioms, contradictions, fragments from the experiment of living.
				</p>

				<p>
					Take them as coordinates, not commandments. If they help you move faster, suffer less, see more clearly—use them. If not, improve them. The experiment is bigger than me. The book is open source—text and code. The repo's public. Fork it, branch it, build your own.
