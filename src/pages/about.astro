	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		In a world increasingly shaped by algorithms, artificial intelligence, and digital connections, we believe it's more important than ever to maintain our humanity. Our mission is to create a space for deep thinking about the questions that matter most: How do we maintain authentic connections in a digital world? What does it mean to be human when machines can think? How do we preserve our values and ethics in an age of rapid technological change?
