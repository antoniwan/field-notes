				<p>
					I've carried this book since college. Back then I thought: if others could fast-forward past my mistakes—the wasted effort, the needless suffering, the boring drama—they could reach clarity sooner. Twenty years later, with notebooks full of tested lessons from work, family, and failure, I'm finally publishing them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Field Notes on (Modern) Humanity isn't theory. It's a report: what I've seen, what I've tried, what broke, what held. Notes, axioms, contradictions—fragments from the experiment of living. My aim is simple: cut the detours, give you substance, and let you decide what to carry forward.
				</p>

				<p>
					And because the experiment is bigger than me, the book is open source—text and code. The repository is public; fork it, propose changes, build your own branch. Historians, parents, anthropologists, wanderers—anyone curious about the human project—can add to it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Why me? Because these aren't abstractions. I've built and failed, raised children of mine and not mine, loved and lost, killed my ego more times than I can count. I've learned that intellect without emotional intelligence is empty. Happiness, if it comes, isn't from a clean life but from a real one.
				</p>

				<p>
					Take these notes as coordinates, not commandments. Use them if they help you move faster, suffer less, or see more clearly. If they don't, improve them. The repo is open. Humanity's field notes are still in draft.
